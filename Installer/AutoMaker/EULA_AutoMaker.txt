C ENTERPRISE (UK) LTD. - END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

Effective Date: 18th April 2018

THANKYOU FOR PURCHASING A ROBOX FROM CEL. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THE TERMS OF THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT").  BY CLICKING ON THE "I AGREE" BUTTON, (1) YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND (2) YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT PERSONALLY, OR IF ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT (EACH A "COMPANY"), AND TO BIND THAT COMPANY TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, YOU SHOULD CLICK ON THE "CANCEL" BUTTON TO DISCONTINUE THE DOWNLOAD/INSTALLATION OF THE AUTOMAKER SOFTWARE AND DESTROY OR RETURN THE SOFTWARE AND ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION TO CEL.

1. This Agreement. 
This Software Agreement ("Agreement") is between you (or the company you represent), the End User, and C ENTERPRISE (UK) LTD. ("CEL") for i) the AutoMaker™ software package (the "licensed software"), (ii) all the contents of the disk(s), CD-ROM(s), flash drive(s), electronic mail and its file attachments, or other media with which this Agreement is provided, including the object code form of the software delivered via a CD-ROM, electronic mail or Web page (iii) digital images, stock photographs, clip art, or other artistic work ("Stock Files") (iv) related explanatory written materials and any other possible documentation related thereto ("Documentation"); (v) fonts (vi) upgrades, modified versions, updates, additions (collectively "Updates"), if any, licensed to You by CEL under this Agreement. You may need devices that meet the system and compatibility requirements for the Licensed Software, which may change from time to time. This is an agreement on end user rights and not an agreement for sale. CEL continues to own the copy of the Software and the physical media contained in the sales package and any other copy that You are authorized to make pursuant to this Agreement. 

By accepting this Agreement, you are also accepting the additional terms and conditions, if any, set forth therein. By installing the Licensed Software you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.  If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or do not have the authority warranted above, do not download or use the Licensed Software.

(a) Updates. 
You may need to install updates to the Licensed Software that we introduce from time to time to use the Licensed Software.  The Licensed Software may communicate with CEL Technology servers from time to time to check for available updates to the Licensed Products and to the functionality of the Licensed Products, such as bug fixes, patches, enhanced functions, missing plug-ins and new versions (collectively, "Updates").

(b) Network Access. 
The Licensed Software may provide features and functionality that allow you to access your Cloud library and/or other online services or repositories (together, the "Networked Services").   You must log into your Robox account and be connected to the Internet to access the Networked Services.  By accessing these online services, you will be subject to the Terms of Use posted there.

(c) Cloud Library.
The Licensed Software may provide features and functionality that allow you to store, retrieve, and/or manage digital content, such as stl or gcode files ("Your Files") in a cloud library (the "Cloud Library").  CEL may use, access and retain Your Files stored in the Cloud Library in order to provide the service to you and enforce the terms of the Agreement, and you expressly give us all permissions we need to do so.  These permissions include the rights to copy Your Files for backup purposes and access Your Files to provide technical support.  You are responsible for backing up, to your own computer or other device any of Your Files that you store or access via the cloud library.  CEL does not guarantee or warrant that any of Your Files that you may store or access through the Cloud Library will not be subject to inadvertent damage, corruption or loss. CEL respects your privacy and Your Files are subject to the CEL Privacy Policy (found at http://www.cel-robox.com/legal).

(d) User Content.
You acknowledge that CEL is not responsible or liable in any way for any of Your Files and has no duty to pre-screen Your Files.  However, CEL reserves the right at all times to determine whether Your Files are appropriate and in compliance with this Agreement, and may pre-screen, move, refuse, modify and/or remove Your files at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, if Your Files are found to be in violation of this Agreement or are otherwise objectionable. There may be limits on the types of content you can store in the cloud library using the Licensed Software, such as file types we don't support. CEL reserves the right to set storage limits for the cloud library.

2. End User Rights and Use.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, CEL grants to you a nontransferable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, revocable, worldwide license (without the right to sublicense) to permit you and those individuals authorised by you or your Company ("Users") to install, use, execute and display the Licensed Software, in executable object code format only, solely for your (or the Company's) own internal business operations. If you submit data to an Internet site hosted by CEL or its affiliates, you will be subject to the Terms of Use posted on such sites.

3. Limitations on End User Rights.
You may not copy, distribute, or make derivative works of the Licensed Software except as follows:

(a) You may make one copy of the Licensed Software on magnetic/flash media as an archival backup copy, provided Your archival backup copy is not installed or used on any computer. Any other copies You make of the Licensed Software are in violation of this Agreement.

(b) You may not use, modify, translate, reproduce or transfer the right to use the Licensed Software or copy the Licensed Software except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

(c) You may not resell, sublicense, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host, outsource, disclose or otherwise commercially exploit the Licensed Software or make the Licensed Software available to any third party other than an authorised User.

(d) You may not reverse engineer, reverse compile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Software (except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by law) or create derivative works based on the Software.

(e) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Licensed Software may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means, including but not limited to electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or other means

(e) Unless stated otherwise in the Documentation, You shall not display, modify, reproduce and distribute any of the Stock Files included with the Software. In the event that the Documentation allows You to display the Stock Files, You shall not distribute the Stock Files on a stand-alone basis, i.e., in circumstances in which the Stock Files constitute the primary value of the product being distributed. You should review the "Read-Me" files associated with the Stock Files that You use to ascertain what rights You have with respect to such materials. Stock Files may not be used in the production of libelous, defamatory, fraudulent, infringing, lewd, obscene or pornographic material or in any otherwise illegal manner. You may not register or claim any rights in the Stock Files or derivative works thereof.

(f) You agree that You shall only use the Licensed Software in a manner that complies with all applicable laws in the jurisdiction in which You use the Software, including, but not limited to, applicable restrictions concerning copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right.

(g) Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Licensed Software shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement, unless CEL expressly states otherwise.  Neither CEL nor any of its suppliers is obligated to provide any services, updates or upgrades to the Licensed Software.  You shall preserve all copyright and other proprietary rights notices in the Licensed Software and all copies thereof.

4. Open-Source Software.
The Licensed Software includes components that are incorporated into or distributed with the Licensed Software, but are actually licensed to you under one or more "open-source" or "free software" licenses (the "Open Source Licensed Software").  The LICENSE text file that accompanies the Licensed Software identifies the Open Source Licensed Software and contains third-party notices that CEL is required to provide to you in conjunction with the Open Source Licensed Software. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Open Source Licensed Software is not licensed under (and is not subject to the terms of) this Agreement, and instead is separately licensed to you pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective open-source software licenses.  Copies of such open-source software licenses are reproduced in the LICENSE text file, and you hereby agree to comply with the terms and conditions of such open-source software license agreements.

5. Consent To Use Of Data. 
When you use the Licensed Software you may automatically be opted in to sharing certain usage statistics (the "Usage Statistics") with CEL. The Usage Statistics may include, but are not limited to date and time of action, type of action, any parameters associated with the type of action, your IP address, and your Robox username or Serial No. Your username will only be shared if you are also logged in to the CEL Robox website and/or the Licensed Software. When you are opted-in to share these usage statistics with CEL, the Licensed Software will automatically connect to the Internet and send this information to CEL's and/or any or all of its service providers' servers. The purpose of collecting this information is to gather product usage information for product development purposes and provision of technical support. CEL will use, process, and retain this information in accordance with the CEL Privacy Policy (found at http://www.cel-robox.com/legal). You acknowledge and agree that the CEL Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time by CEL and that, effective upon posting on the CEL or Robox Web Site or other written notice from CEL, you will be subject to such changes.  If you do not agree to the collection and these uses of the usage statistics, please open the AutoMaker Preferences and opt out of sharing the usage statistics with CEL.

6. Copyright.
The Software and all rights, title and interest, without limitation including proprietary rights therein (including any and all copies thereof but excluding any Open Source Licensed Software included therein), are owned by CEL and are protected by international treaty provisions and all other applicable national laws of the country in which it is being used. The structure, organisation and code of the Software are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of CEL and/or its licensors and affiliates. You must not copy the Software, except as set forth in clause 3 (Limitations On End User Rights). Any copies which You are permitted to make pursuant to this Agreement must contain the same copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on the Software. Any rights not expressly granted by CEL in this Agreement are reserved.  You acknowledge that you acquire no ownership interest in the Licensed Software by virtue of downloading or using the Licensed Software.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW NEITHER CEL, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES NOR THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS OR OTHER RIGHTS. THERE IS NO WARRANTY BY CEL OR BY ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. CEL BELIEVES ITS PRODUCTS WORK AS INTENDED, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT USE ANY CEL HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE IN ANY SITUATIONS WHERE HEALTH OR SAFETY MIGHT BE AT RISK.  IN ADDITION, CEL MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE FITNESS OF CEL'S HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE FOR THE DESIGN OR CONSTRUCTION OF PARTS OR COMPONENTS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION IN YOUR JURISDICTION, SUCH AS TOYS, WEAPONS, OR MEDICAL DEVICES.  IN ADDITION, CEL PRODUCTS SHOULD NOT BE USED BY UNTRAINED OR UNDERAGE USERS. YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR THE SELECTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS AND FOR THE INSTALLATION, USE AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM IT. IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF DOWNLOAD.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL CEL, ITS EMPLOYEES OR LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, SALES, DATA OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION OR FOR ANY SPECIAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, ECONOMIC, COVER, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND WHETHER ARISING UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF CEL OR ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES ARE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME COUNTRIES/STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED, IN SUCH CASES, CEL, ITS EMPLOYEES OR LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO USD$1.00.

9. Application of Limitations and Disclaimers to Consumers.
The limitations or exclusions of warranties and liability contained in this Agreement do not affect or prejudice your statutory rights as a consumer, i.e., a person acquiring goods otherwise than in the course of a business.  The limitations or exclusions of warranties and remedies contained in this Agreement shall apply to you only to the extent such limitations or exclusions and remedies are permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located. Nothing contained in this Agreement limits CEL's liability to You in the event of death or personal injury resulting from CELs negligence. CEL is acting on behalf of its employees and licensors or affiliates for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and/or restricting obligations, warranties and liability as provided in this clause 8, but in no other respects and for no other purpose.

10. Basis of Bargain.
The warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of this Agreement between CEL and You.  CEL would not be able to provide the Licensed Software on an economic basis without such limitations.  The warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability inure to the benefit of CEL's suppliers.

11. Commencement and Termination.
This Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder are effective on the date you download the Licensed Software and shall continue unless and until this Agreement is terminated by CEL pursuant to this section.  CEL may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice in the event that you materially breach any of the terms hereof.  Upon termination, the license granted hereunder shall terminate and you shall immediately destroy any copies of the Licensed Software in your possession, but the terms of this Agreement which are intended to survive termination will remain in effect.  Your obligations under sections 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive the expiration or termination of this agreement.

12. Indemnity.
You agree to indemnify and hold CEL (and its officers/directors, employees, and agents) harmless from and against all damages losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees and costs) related to any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) your use of the Licensed Software, (b) your violation of this Agreement; or (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations. CEL reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us and you agree to cooperate with our defence of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of CEL. CEL will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

13. Miscellaneous
Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under this Agreement are assignable by you, and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void and without effect. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be contrary to law, then such provision shall be construed as nearly as possible to reflect the intention of the parties, with the other provisions remaining in full force and effect.  Any notice to you may be provided by email.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and any and all written or oral agreements previously existing between the parties are expressly cancelled.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any modifications of this Agreement must be in writing and agreed to by both parties.

This is the entire agreement between CEL and You relating to the Software and it supersedes any prior representations, discussions, undertakings, end user agreements, communications or advertising relating to the Software.

Other Licenses:

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
