calibrationMenu.nozzleAlignment=Nozzle Alignment
calibrationPanel.adjustNozzleOffsets=Adjust nozzle offsets
calibrationPanel.calibrateB=Calibrate Nozzle Opening
calibrationPanel.calibrateZOffset=Calibrate Nozzle Height
calibrationPanel.calibrationCommencedMessageFine=AutoMaker now needs to determine the 'opening point' of the needle valve. The valve will be gradually opened every time you click 'Not Present'. Repeatedly press the 'Not Present' button until material can be seen, then press the 'Present' button.
calibrationPanel.calibrationCommencedMessageFill=Now the fill nozzle - do you see any material being extruded? Repeatedly press the 'Not Present' button until material can be seen, then press the 'Present' button.
calibrationPanel.calibrationSucceededMessage=Calibration successful! The head configuration of your Robox has been updated.
calibrationPanel.cancelCalibration=Cancel
calibrationPanel.chooseCalibration=Please choose the type of calibration you require.
calibrationPanel.chooseNozzleOffsetMode=Choose an option
calibrationPanel.ensureHeadIsCleanBMessage=Ensure the nozzles are clean - Use the tweezers to remove material from the openings at the bottom so when the needle valves are opened it is obvious material is being ejected.
calibrationPanel.present=Present
calibrationPanel.headCleanCheck=Before continuing to the next step, please remove any extruded material using tweezers. Click Next to continue.
calibrationPanel.heating=AutoMaker is now heating up the printhead in preparation for calibration - please wait...
calibrationPanel.initialisingOffset=Before starting the calibration please remove the printer bed by moving the locking handle (highlighted) to the left, removing the tip wipe blade and then lifting the sheet and sliding towards you. You will need a small sheet of plain paper for the calibration and a pair of tweezers/small pliers would also be helpful for removing waste filament.
calibrationPanel.insertPieceOfPaper=Place a piece of paper underneath the left nozzle. Then click Next, and Robox will move down to grip the sheet of paper.
calibrationPanel.isMaterialExtrudingNozzle0=Is material coming out the left nozzle?
calibrationPanel.isMaterialExtrudingNozzle1=Is material coming out of the right nozzle?
calibrationPanel.justRight=Just right
calibrationPanel.measuringZOffset=Robox is now determining the difference in height between the two nozzles. Please wait..
calibrationPanel.moveThePaperInstruction=Use the up and down arrows to adjust the height of the head. Find the lowest position that allows the paper to slide freely beneath the nozzles without touching it. When you've found this point, click Next to complete the calibration.
calibrationPanel.notPresent=Not Present
calibrationPanel.nozzleCalibrationFailed=Sorry, it seems nozzle opening calibration has failed. Before contacting us, please repeat the calibration, being sure you have read and followed the instructions carefully. Ensure the nozzles are clean and material is running freely with good clean output from both nozzles - if in doubt, run the purge sequence again (in Maintenance). If your product repeatedly fails the calibration tests, please take a look at the solutions available at http://robox.freshdesk.com - if you are still unable to resolve your issue, please raise a support ticket, and we will get in touch as soon as we can.
calibrationPanel.nozzleOffsetCalibrationTitle=Nozzle offset calibration
calibrationPanel.primingNozzle=Priming nozzle
calibrationPanel.readyToBeginNozzleOffsetCalibration=If you are having problems with layer adhesion or inconsistencies in the height of the first few layers, please complete this calibration sequence. As the print head switches between nozzles, the nozzle which is not printing is lifted up and out of the way of the print. Therefore the software needs to know the difference in height between the two nozzles when they are in their printing position. This routine calibrates that lift height.
calibrationPanel.readyToBeginNozzleOpeningCalibration=This routine is used to calibrate the point at which the needle valves in the head operate. The firmware has to know the point at which the plastic begins to flow in order to accurately control extrusion. Before beginning the calibration sequence ensure that the bed is clear of objects, the nozzles are clean and you have a SmartReel loaded. A pair of tweezers/small pliers would also be helpful for removing waste filament.
calibrationPanel.recalibrate=Recalibrate
calibrationPanel.replacePEIBed=Replace the PEI bed by first sliding into the tray, ensuring the surface is beneath the clips on all sides. Slide all the way to the back, and then move the locking handle (highlighted) to the right to secure in place. Finally, re-insert the tip wipe blade and click Next to complete the calibration.
calibrationPanel.retryCalibration=Retry

calibrationPanel.stepXOfY=Step %s of %s
calibrationPanel.title=Calibration
calibrationPanel.tooLoose=Too loose
calibrationPanel.tooTight=Too tight
calibrationPanel.valvesClosedNoMaterial=Now the nozzles are heated, you need to check if the nozzles are completely sealed when the valve is fully closed. Do you see any material coming from either nozzle?
calibrationPanel.valvesClosedNoMaterialPostCalibration=AutoMaker will now verify the calibration. Is any material flowing from either nozzle?
calibrationPanel.valvesOpenMaterialExtruding=Now, nozzles open - you should see material flowing alternately from both nozzles - is this correct?
calibrationPanel.xAndYIntroduction=If you are having problems with parts of the print being misaligned, please complete this calibration sequence. This routine is used to set the alignment of the two printing nozzles in the X and Y direction. This allows Robox to know the location of each nozzle in respect to the other. Please ensure that the bed is clean and clear of obstructions, you have already completed the nozzle opening and nozzle height calibrations and you have a SmartReel loaded and ready to print. If PLA is available then it is recommended to use that.
calibrationPanel.xAndYPrintPattern=AutoMaker will now print a calibration pattern - please wait...
calibrationPanel.xAndYGetOffsets=Remove the print from the bed and look for the best alignment between the output from each nozzle in the X and Y axes. Enter the number and letter which corresponds to the best aligned pair for each direction in the boxes below:
calibrationPanel.xAndYPrintingCircle=Robox will now print a circular test pattern to verify the alignment procedure.
calibrationPanel.xAndYPrintCircleCheck=The first nozzle cross should lie exactly in the centre of the second nozzle cross. If this is not well aligned, you will need to run the calibration procedure again. If you are satisfied, click Next to continue.
